## Repository Overview
This repository contains the dataset and resources for the research paper "Limitations of AI Self-Detection for Identifying Paraphrased Text" by Antonio Junior Alves Caiado and Michael Hahsler. The study focuses on the ability of AI systems like ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude to distinguish their own generated text from human-written content.

## Paper Abstract
The paper addresses authorship attribution challenges in generative AI tools, particularly in academic contexts. It introduces AI self-detection, where AI models identify their own text. The study, involving models like ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, explores their self-detection capabilities, underlining the need for improved methods to differentiate AI-generated content for academic integrity.

## Dataset
The dataset includes essays on 50 topics, created by AI models and human writers. Each AI model produced original essays and their paraphrased versions. This data was crucial for assessing the self-detection abilities of the AI systems.
