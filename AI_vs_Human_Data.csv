Media representations can act as mental shortcuts that form reflexive opinions without critical analysis. However, audiences are not passive; existing values shape susceptibility to media messaging. Still, media bias limits the perspectives people encounter. Concentrated corporate ownership of news media also risks diversity of discourse. While the internet democratizes participation in media, echo chambers still restrict exposure to opposing viewpoints. Ensuring accuracy, inclusive sourcing, diversity of ownership, and audience agency can improve media's role in enabling nuanced public opinion rather than reactive polarization.",,,AI,Human
AI,Claude,Yes,Biodiversity Conservation and Ecosystem Restoration,"The accelerating global extinction crisis threatens over one million species with catastrophic consequences for humanity. Habitat destruction, exploitation, pollution and climate change are decimating biodiversity worldwide. Preserving remaining ecosystems and restoring damaged habitats are urgent priorities. Protected areas effectively conserve biodiversity by creating refuges from human activities. International cooperation can protect critical transboundary ecosystems and migratory species. Addressing overconsumption and unsustainable resource extraction is also vital to reducing pressures on nature. Restoration of forests, grasslands, wetlands and coral reefs can rehabilitate ecosystem health and resilience. Reintroducing native plant and animal species revitalizes ecological communities. However, preventing degradation is more effective than attempting to restore harmed ecosystems. Indigenous knowledge and community management are essential for successful conservation and restoration. While technology like satellite monitoring aids habitat protection, conservation ultimately necessitates understanding our integral relationship with nature. A profound shift in cultural values and economic systems is required to preserve biodiversity for current and future generations. Governments must prioritize conservation spending and sustainable development. We cannot prosper without functional, flourishing ecosystems. Urgent action is needed to conserve remaining biodiversity, restore damaged ecosystems and fundamentally transform humanity's relationship with nature through compassion and cooperation.",,,AI,Human
AI,Claude,Yes,Challenges and Benefits of 3D Printing Technology,"3D printing technology enables objects to be created from digital files by laying down successive thin layers of material. This transformative technology allows on-demand, customized manufacturing with applications across industries. However, 3D printing also presents unique challenges. A key limitation is the narrow range of usable materials, many of which lack durability for end products. The quality and resolution of prints are often inferior to conventionally made goods. 3D printers remain expensive for most consumers and businesses. There are also safety risks like harmful emitted particles or flammable powders. Intellectual property concerns arise from the ease of pirating and replicating 3D designs. Nonetheless, 3D printing provides major benefits including democratized production, streamlined supply chains, rapid prototyping, and highly personalized products. Healthcare leverages 3D printing for customized prosthetics, implants and pharmaceuticals. Manufacturers use 3D printing for quick design iteration, simplified tooling and small-batch production. Aerospace, automotive, and defense employ 3D printing to construct lightweight, complex components. As 3D printing technologies progress, smart combinations of additive and traditional subtractive techniques can maximize strengths while mitigating limitations. With thoughtful regulation and continued innovation, 3D printing promises to empower businesses and consumers, enable mass customization, reduce waste, and facilitate creativity.",,,AI,Human
AI,Claude,Yes,Privacy Concerns with Emerging Technologies,"Rapid technological advances are outpacing privacy protections, raising critical concerns about surveillance and data exploitation. Biometrics like facial recognition and digital fingerprinting enable pervasive tracking, often without adequate consent. Drones equipped with cameras stealthily monitor public spaces, while smart home devices analyze intimate conversations. The Internet of Things embeds net-connected sensors into appliances and infrastructure, collecting granular behavioral data. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence facilitates large-scale data aggregation, predictive analytics and automated decision-making with inherent biases. Genetic testing and wearable health trackers reveal sensitive medical information. The ubiquity of data collection, ambiguity around consent and ownership, and lack of anonymity or expiration render personal information perpetually exploitable. While technologies provide convenience, their overreach into privacy must be constrained. Governments must update policies and regulations to protect civil liberties in the digital age. Companies should implement privacy and ethics by design, using only essential user data while permitting opt-outs. Individuals should better educate themselves on privacy risks and take measures like minimizing sharing, using encryption and pseudonyms, and advocating their digital rights. With vigilant safeguards and oversight, emerging technologies can advance without sacrificing personal privacy.",,,AI,Human
AI,Claude,Yes,Semiconductor Industry In Future,"Semiconductors will continue driving technological innovation, necessitating massive investments to sustain Moore’s Law and meet growing demand. The shift to electric vehicles and clean energy requires more advanced power electronics, controllers, and sensors. Edge computing for 5G networks and the Internet of Things relies on decentralized smart chipsets. Artificial intelligence applications depend on parallel graphics processing units. Meeting these needs demands advances in architectures like 3D stacking and new materials such as carbon nanotubes. However, fabrication is approaching physical limits as transistors reach atomic scale. This requires pioneering techniques like spintronics, quantum computing, neuromorphic computing and photonic computing. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions threaten semiconductor supply chains and access to rare earth minerals. Greater domestic manufacturing capacity will reduce reliance on Asia. Further automation using AI and advanced robotics will optimize production. Design software and testing methodologies will also improve. Startups will disrupt the industry with innovative packaging methods and proprietary architectures. Legacy firms will consolidate through mergers while also cultivating agility through internal startups. Government investments in research and workforce development are crucial to ensure competitiveness.

AI,Claude,Yes,Coco Harvesting costing,"Coco harvesting costs include various factors like labor, equipment, transportation, facilities, processing, and land and tree expenditures. Labor is a major cost, especially if harvesting is manual on small farms without automation. The wages and availability of workers greatly affects labor costs. Equipment such as harvesting tools, collection bags, and vehicles for transportation also require capital investment and continual maintenance outlays. Fuel for machines and vehicles contributes to operating costs. Extra processing of the coco crop including dehusking, washing, drying and packaging adds processing overheads. Safe storage facilities represent a fixed cost component too. The expenses of the land itself plus planting, maintaining and growing the coconut trees influence the economics of operating a coco plantation. The coconut trees signify a capital asset that's amortized over the productive lifetime of the trees. Government policies, regulations, subsidies and taxes may create costs or incentives that change coco harvesting economics. The yields achieved based on coconut variety, climate, farming practices and tree health determine productivity which allows fixed and operating costs to be spread over production volume. Quality requirements and desired oil content also affect processing methods. Overall, coco harvesting costs encompass various labor, material, facility, regulatory and asset-related factors spanning the entire coco production and supply chain.",,,Human,Human

Human,None,,Genetic Engineering,"Religion provides the strongest grounds for protesting genetic engineering. So it is not surprising that most of the resistance to all new reproductive technologies comes from people with religious beliefs. This resistance is deeply rooted in fundamental religious norms.

 

According to the Judeo-Christian tradition, humans were created in the “image” and “likeness” of God (Genesis 1:26-27), which, according to some interpreters, means both the given nature of man and their perfection, the goal towards which they must strive; and from the point of view of others, “image” and “likeness” are synonymous. Humans are likened to God, first of all, in that they were given power over nature (Ps. 8), and also in that they received from the Creator the “breath of life.” Thanks to this, a person becomes a “living soul.” This concept means a living personality, the unity of vital forces, the “I” of a person. Soul and flesh are characterized by organic unity (in contrast to the Greek philosophical dualism, which contrasted spirit and flesh).

 

Some people believe genetic engineering is morally wrong because it interferes with God’s plan for humanity. They believe that we are playing with fire by altering the genes of living organisms and that this could have catastrophic consequences for both humans and the environment.",Human,Human,AI,Human
Human,None,,Healthcare Access and Reform,"The typical American’s health compares poorly to that of their counterparts in other high-income countries, even though the U.S. spends twice as much as these countries do on medical care. Behind that middling average lies substantial health inequality. A 40-year-old American male can expect to live 15 years less if he’s one of the poorest 1% of Americans rather than one of the richest 1%. Black children who live in the richest parts of the United States have higher mortality rates than White children in the poorest parts of the country.

Many have put these observations together with another aspect of U.S. “exceptionalism”: We are the only high-income country without universal health insurance coverage. And they have concluded that the key to improving health and reducing health inequality in the U.S. is to finally enact universal coverage.

They’re wrong. While these two facts are correct, they have very little to do with each other. There are good reasons to support universal health coverage, but noticeably improving population health is not one of them.

Indeed, the evidence suggests that the health disparities among Americans are not driven by differences in access to health insurance or to medical care. Rather, the key to improving health is far more complex: It lies in changing health behaviors and reducing exposure to external sources of poor health.

Perhaps the clearest evidence for how little impact health insurance reform has on health comes from the experience of other countries which have universal health insurance but also experience substantial health inequality. Consider Sweden and Norway, two Nordic countries with universal health insurance as well as a cradle-to-grave generous social safety net. Yet differences in life expectancy between adults in the top 10% and bottom 10% of the national income distribution in those countries are similar to the disparities in the United States.",AI,Human,Human,AI
Human,None,,Automation and the Future of Work,"The future of automation and AI is a topic that has been debated for decades. Some believe that automation will take away jobs from humans and this will be the end of the world as we know it. While others believe that AI will create more jobs than it takes away. 

This debate is still ongoing, but there are some facts about how automation and AI are affecting our lives today. We can see how automation has impacted the workforce in different industries such as manufacturing, transportation, healthcare and many more. 

The impact of automating various roles in these industries can be seen by looking at what happened to employment rates in these sectors after technological advancements were made. For instance, employment rates dropped significantly after the introduction of automated manufacturing systems such as industrial robots or computer-controlled machine tools.

The future of jobs is uncertain, but one thing is certain – automation will play a major role in the future

It has already started to happen. 

Automation has been happening since the Industrial Revolution, but it was not until recently that the pace of automation increased. In fact, there are now more jobs lost than created by automation. 

We must understand what automation means and what we can do about it. 

In the future, automation and AI will have a major impact on jobs in fields such as engineering, law, medicine, and even journalism. 

This will lead to a different kind of job creation that focuses more on creativity and emotions than just coding or data analysis.

How Artificial Intelligence is changing the way work is performed 

Automation is already replacing human workers with robots. This could be in the form of software, machines, and robots. This trend has been going on for a long time and is predicted to continue for a long time.

The benefits of automation are that it can – 

reduce labour costs
increase productivity
and improve quality
However, this trend also poses some challenges such as job displacement and worker re-skilling. 

The future of work is changing day by day. With the help of AI, work can be more efficient and less time-consuming. 

Artificial Intelligence has been around for a while now. But in the last few years, it has made a huge impact on the way we work. AI can do tasks that were considered impossible just a few years ago and it will continue to change our lives in the near future. 

AI can read data, learn from them and provide insights about them on its own without any human input. This makes it possible for companies to automate some of their business processes with much less human input needed than before. 

How will automation affect your career? And does it make sense to be concerned? 

The first and most obvious change that automation has brought about is the loss of jobs. This has been especially true in manufacturing, transportation, and agriculture. In these sectors, such as trucking and farming, automation has reduced labour costs drastically. 

We are living in a time when automation is becoming increasingly popular. Automation is the process of using machines or computer programs to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence, such as manual work. 

All individuals need to hone their skills. If you don’t do it, you will be losing job opportunities. Acquire a skill that’s relevant to the market to the current situation. 

Think of some business goals that are in line with AI and automation. If you could employ AIs and automation in your favour, you will be boosting your career growth. In the past, automation has always been seen as a threat to jobs. However, with recent advancements in technology and AI, it has become more favourable to use automation rather than humans. This is because it can lead to greater efficiency and improve productivity. 

Employers need to be aware of the benefits and drawbacks of automation so they can make informed decisions about how they want to use it in their business. Employers should also consider the impact on employees when making decisions about whether or not they will automate their business processes. 

Examples of jobs taken away by automation: 

Factory workers replaced by robots 
Taxi drivers replaced by self-driving cars 
Retail store cashiers replaced by self-checkout systems 
On the other hand, AI has the potential to provide more job opportunities for humans in the future. 

Examples of job opportunities created with AIs and automation: 

Software developer opportunities to create bots 
Data Scientists 
Research and development 
Which jobs are most likely to be replaced by automated processes? 

The process of automation has been happening for a long time; it is just that the rate at which it is happening has been increasing. 

Automation is not a new phenomenon. There have been automated processes in different fields such as manufacturing and farming for a long time. However, the pace of automation has increased in recent years due to technological advancements and the rise of AI. 

The use of AI tools has also been on the rise to help companies automate repetitive tasks. 

The most recent trend is to automate customer service calls with bots or conversational AIs, which are computer programs designed to mimic human interactions over text or voice communication channels.

Some jobs are more likely to be replaced by automated processes than others. The most common jobs that are at risk of being replaced by automation include administrative assistants, telemarketers, data entry and drivers. 

The types of jobs that have a lower risk of being replaced by automation include: 

In the long run, automation will replace jobs that are highly repetitive and require little skill. For example, most of the jobs that have a lower risk of being replaced by automation include: 

Jobs with high levels of creativity and autonomy 
Jobs that require a lot of social interaction 
Jobs that require creativity and emotional intelligence 
How can we start using AI now to prepare for the future jobs that will be lost in 10 years? 

There are many industries where AI has already made a huge impact. This includes areas like finance, healthcare, transportation, and education. In the future, AI will be able to do even more things that humans can’t do now. 

The future of jobs will be uncertain and many factors have to be considered when trying to predict what jobs will exist in the future. However, it is important to prepare for these changes because it takes time to retrain human employees so they can adapt to the new job requirements. 

Debate on AI is endless, it has two sides that are going to continue. The wait is to see its real impact. Governments and corporates need to create and secure some more job opportunities that are relevant to the current world situation. 

There are many different ways in which we can start using AI now so that we can prepare for the future jobs that will be lost in 10 years. One way is by understanding how AI works and how it could help us instead of replacing us. Another way is to train AI to use data in a way that benefits humanity. 

The efficiency of each individual is indeed leveraged by asking them to do the work that only humans are capable of. It’s a win-win situation for AI and human working professionals.

For some, this has been a blessing in disguise, with teachers using new technology and versatile communication skills to facilitate learning otherwise restricted, with time and resources offered to students to self-regulate, expand and evolve their preferred ways of learning. For others, it has been a waste of time, and for many, it has given further leeway to the worst that e-technology can do to young minds and bodies.

In most places in the world, choice in how to learn is severely restricted for the under 18s. This not only restricts the scope of their education and general development but also leaves them unaware of their online and blended work options.

Expanding Choice In Education
Expanding choice in education with the innovative use of new technology for learning, combining digital and actual localities to overcome restrictions in collaboration, and coexistence beyond borders can establish freedom of choice in learning where it does not exist but also reinforce and expand it where it does. Legislation reform action becomes easier and faster.

Also, the option of digital and blended education is a foundation for many other freedoms. For educational reformists around the globe, the main motivation is to ensure health and well-being in the context of learning, returning learning to the community and connecting micro-communities and macro-communities.

Human,None,,Ongoing Global Pandemic Preparedness,"To help countries better prepare for future pandemics, WHO launched a new initiative today that provides guidance on integrated planning for responding to any respiratory pathogen such as influenza or coronaviruses.

The new Preparedness and Resilience for Emerging Threats Initiative, or PRET, incorporates the latest tools and approaches for shared learning and collective action established during the COVID-19 pandemic and other recent public health emergencies. 

Through the initiative, WHO will use a mode of transmission approach to guide countries in pandemic planning, given that many capacities and capabilities are common among groups of pathogens. PRET answers the call for technical guidance and support for promoting and strengthening integrated preparedness and response, as outlined in World Health Assembly resolutions. 

The COVID-19 pandemic and other health emergencies have shown that countries need to be operationally ready to respond to infectious disease threats, with tailored preparedness plans in hand and better coordination and collaboration with other sectors such as agriculture. 

“Preparedness, prevention, and response activities must not be the province of the health sector alone,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Just as health emergencies have impacts across many sectors, so must our preparedness and response efforts span sectors, disciplines and pathogens. It is critical, too, that community engagement and equity are the centre of our efforts, especially for those populations that are marginalized and most at risk.”

PRET is an evolution in WHO’s approach to pandemic preparedness through the application of a mode of transmission lens, rather than a focus on specific diseases. WHO will continue to develop and disseminate guidance on specific diseases as needed. 

The launch of the initiative is taking place on the last day of meetings with over 120 individuals representing Member States, partners, and the WHO secretariat, to define the path forward for PRET, including the development of a global implementation roadmap for respiratory pathogen pandemic preparedness.

The PRET Initiative’s first module focuses on respiratory pathogens, including influenza, coronaviruses, and respiratory syncytial virus. Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the possible threat of avian influenza, this module will enable countries to critically review, test, and update their respiratory pandemic planning efforts to ensure they have the functional capacities and capabilities in place.

A process is underway to identify the next group of pathogens, such as arboviruses, to be addressed under this initiative. This will follow priorities identified through the ten proposals to strengthen the global architecture for health emergency preparedness, response, and resilience (HEPR). 

The PRET Initiative ushers in a new era for pandemic preparedness and represents an evolution of WHO’s core activities to support all Member States in strengthening health emergency preparedness, prevention, and response capacities and capabilities. The initiative can also serve to operationalize the objectives and provisions of the Pandemic Accord, which is currently being negotiated by WHO Member States.

Human,None,,Future of Transportation: Electric and Autonomous Vehicles,"Self-driving cars are already on the road and they’ll become more common in the years ahead. These days, they’re mostly being used in tests, but that will change soon enough. Not only could self-driving cars lead to a reduction in traffic fatalities, but they could also reduce pollution and reshape how people live. Plus, companies like Amazon have already started testing self-driving delivery trucks and other businesses can’t wait to use this technology for their purposes. Some of us may still be wary about riding in a driverless vehicle, but, likely, we won’t be able to avoid them for too much longer.

Adoption
Self-driving cars will be adopted faster than the average person expects. A lot of people think that it’s going to take a long time for self-driving cars to be widely available and used, but I believe they’ll happen much sooner than most people think. Over 70 million vehicles on the road already have some level of autonomy when compared with just 450,000 in 2019. In the future, there’s going to be an even bigger jump in adoption.

Human,None,,Renewable Energy Policies and Implementation,"For most of the twentieth century, large-scale, utility-owned power plants dominated electricity generation in the United States. Today, however, a growing share of electricity comes from renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy, which are often small-scale and distributed. In the absence of significant national policies, the Renewable Portfolio Standard has emerged as the key state-level policy governing the deployment and use of renewable energy sources. While renewable energy offers new possibilities for clean energy generation, it also poses new regulatory and governance challenges as a wide range of stakeholders, such as the utilities, regulatory agencies, environmental and consumer advocacy groups, electricity generators, and private citizens, increasingly seek to influence how Renewable Portfolio Standards are implemented. In this study, we ask how and why do stakeholders participate in decision-making about how these policies are implemented? Given the unique context of renewable energy policy, the long-term and iterative nature of renewable energy policy implementation, and the wide range of actors involved, we look at the suite of participatory opportunities available to stakeholders. We interview stakeholders in two states—Colorado and Nevada—to identify the mechanisms through which stakeholders participate and the incentives (or disincentives) that influence their willingness to do so. We find that while decision makers in both the states use a variety of mechanisms to engage stakeholders in decision-making, meaningful participation may be limited to stakeholder groups that are knowledgeable about the issues, have the resources to engage in long-term and sustained participation, and have long-standing relationships with decision makers and other stakeholders. Although many stakeholders participate in multiple types of processes to achieve a broader range of benefits, they often perceive their participation as superficial; and yet, their continued participation suggests that they may play a long game, building coalitions, relationships, and knowledge to position themselves to influence decisions later on. Finally, we find that the regulatory environment influences which participatory processes are available, the incentives for participation, and ultimately the outcomes of stakeholder participation.",Human,Human,Human,AI

With 5G’s ultra-low latency, remote surgical procedures, autonomous vehicles, and other time-sensitive applications can become a reality. This has far-reaching implications not only in healthcare and transportation but also in areas like gaming, where split-second reactions are crucial.

5G also holds the potential to reshape industries through enhanced connectivity. The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to flourish under 5G. As more devices become interconnected, from smart home appliances to industrial sensors, the robustness and speed of 5G will facilitate seamless data exchange, enabling more efficient processes, predictive maintenance, and improved resource allocation.

Moreover, 5G could bridge the digital divide by providing high-speed internet to remote and underserved areas. Traditional wired infrastructure can be expensive and slow to deploy, making it challenging to connect rural regions. 5G’s wireless nature circumvents this issue, potentially leveling the digital playing field and granting more individuals access to educational resources, job opportunities, and online services.

Challenges

However, the transition to 5G isn’t without challenges. The technology requires a denser network of smaller cell towers due to its shorter wavelength, raising concerns about potential health risks and aesthetic impact. Additionally, the increased frequency range used by 5G may result in a reduced signal range compared to 4G, necessitating a higher number of base stations.

Conclusion

The impact of 5G technology on communication and connectivity is poised to be transformative. From faster data speeds to ultra-low latency, 5G’s capabilities will unlock new dimensions of technological innovation. Industries will be reshaped, from healthcare to transportation, while the IoT landscape will expand exponentially. The potential to provide connectivity to underserved regions is a notable societal benefit, but challenges such as infrastructure deployment and health concerns must also be addressed. As 5G continues to roll out globally, its impact will become increasingly evident, shaping the way we connect and communicate in the digital age.

Human,None,,Water Scarcity and Conservation,"What is water scarcity?
Water Scarcity signifies the shortage of water, an imbalance between the demand and supply of water, also a good quality of water i.e. potable water.

Water is a very important resource, we use water for almost every activity like drinking, washing, cooking, cleaning, etc. This precious resource is largely getting wasted due to human carelessness and lack of planning and hence we are facing the scarcity of water. According to the United Nations, a person needs a minimum of 50 litres of water per day for his basic needs of hygiene, cooking and drinking. But there is a large population which fails to receive this small quantity of water and hence most of the population is getting affected by water scarcity.Insufficient intake of water causes kidney problems, constipation, and various mental changes. Blood pressure and heat flow in our body are maintained by water. The usable water present on earth, therefore, needs to be saved in order to live a healthy and sustainable life.",Human,Human,Human,Human
Human,None,,Mental Health Implications of Social Isolation,"Humans are social beings, and regular social connection, through community, friendship and support networks, is vital for our mental wellbeing.

Social isolation is associated with an increased risk of mental health problems like anxiety and depression – and mental health issues can also increase your chances of feeling lonely. There’s even evidence that social isolation can shorten life span. A study found that people who are socially isolated are more likely to die prematurely, regardless of underlying health issues.

However, while social isolation and loneliness can impair our cognitive function, there’s also evidence that re-socialising and making new connections can reverse the negative effects of isolation. In a recent study conducted during the pandemic, residents who suffered cognitive decline during lockdown quickly recovered when restrictions eased.

How to overcome the effects of social isolation
If you’re feeling disconnected from life and experiencing loneliness, asking for help can be difficult and you might not know where to turn. ‘Often, we don’t want to admit to being lonely, as it carries a strong stigma. But it’s always a good idea to do so,’ says Dr Radecka. ‘It’s important to remember that there’s nothing shameful in feeling lonely – it’s a normal human experience.’

Here are some steps you can take to overcome the effects of social isolation:

1. Make social connections a priority
‘Although it may seem impossible, making small steps to connect with others is important. There are many forms of friendships – but the key here is quality, not quantity,’ explains Dr Radecka. ‘Arrange to chat to someone you haven’t spoken to in a while or set up a weekly phone call.’

2. Engage in the community
Being part of a community gives us a strong sense of belonging. Join a class based on your interests. ‘Doing activities that we enjoy is good for our mental wellbeing and a way to meet new people,’ says Dr Radecka. Try taking part in a book club, dog-walking group or choir or volunteering at a community garden. One study found that group singing significantly boosts psychological wellbeing.

3. Get moving
‘If you’re struggling with social anxiety, keeping physically active can improve your mood and decrease symptoms of depression and anxiety,’ says Dr Radecka. ‘It boosts the feel-good chemicals in the brain and decreases stress hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol.’

4. Ask for help
‘If you feel that social isolation and loneliness are affecting your health, don’t be afraid to reach out to family, friends or a health professional,’ says Dr Radecka.

‘A Livi doctor or therapist can evaluate your symptoms and talk you through treatment options available.’

Human,None,,Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment,"Promoting gender equality and advancing the status of women and girls are vital to achieving our development objectives.

Gender equality is defined in USAID’s Gender Equality and Female Empowerment Policy as a state “in which both men and women have equal opportunity to benefit from and contribute to economic, social, cultural and political development; enjoy socially valued resources and rewards; and realize their human rights.” The U.S. Agency for International Development Regional Development Mission for Asia (USAID/RDMA) is committed to collaborating with partners to bridge gender inequality gaps in programming to advance inclusive growth by strengthening women’s economic empowerment and increasing women’s and girls’ voices in decision-making, leadership and science.

STRENGTHENING WOMEN'S ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT
We support regional economic platforms of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) through networks of women entrepreneurs. The Gender Responsive Economic Actions for the Transformation of Women in ASEAN initiative was launched in 2015 and helped promote products for greater sales to employ more workers and improve livelihoods. The initiative continues to help women-led small and medium-sized enterprises to sell products internationally and protect products’ intellectual property rights from being illegally copied and sold. Also, USAID Green Invest Asia, an activity that identifies and develops promising climate smart business deals with solid profit potential for investors, is making the case for increased women’s participation in agriculture and forestry.

GENDER EQUALITY IN SCIENCE
USAID encourages promising, early-career women scientists in the ASEAN region. The Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research program helps address cultural barriers that dissuade women from research careers by supporting a network of women scientists studying the diversity, distribution and conservation of reptiles and amphibians in the Mekong, as well as the impacts of human activities on these species in Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. In addition, USAID developed an online Gender Sourcebook (http://asiapacificadapt.net/gender-sourcebook/) to ensure that gender equality and female empowerment are incorporated into large-scale climate change adaptation projects. Also, through the USAID Connecting the Mekong Through Education and Training program, young women are encouraged to pursue careers in science, technology, education and mathematics, learning skills with input from industry giants such as Cisco, Intel, Microsoft and National Instruments that will help them finish their studies with a solid chance of a landing a job where hands-on knowledge is most needed.

INTEGRATING WOMEN IN CONSERVATION
The USAID Oceans and Fisheries Partnership is a program designed to combat illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing and protect marine biodiversity in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition to conserving fisheries resources, the program addresses human welfare issues, such as gender equality and the complicated nature of the social and environmental challenges facing the fisheries sector.

PROMOTING HEALTH
USAID works to reduce child stunting in targeted areas of Laos and supports women, men, girls and boys with physical disabilities to gain free access to prosthetic, orthotics and physical therapy. USAID supports programs in Laos that promote good nutrition among women and children under two and enhance water and sanitation hygiene in vulnerable communities. The activities focus on improving maternal and child health to address high child mortality rates and malnutrition. The first 1,000 days between pregnancy and age two is a critical period for ensuring healthy child development. USAID assistance has also helped women and ethnic minorities in remote villages gain access to disability services and strengthened the referrals process through the country’s health system.

QUALITY CARE FOR SURVIVORS OF TRAFFICKING IN ASIA
USAID/RDMA partners with the International Organization for Migration on the IOM X Campaign to encourage safe migration and public action to prevent human trafficking and exploitation in the Asia Pacific region. IOM X builds the capacity of communities and organizations to develop public awareness campaigns that target those vulnerable to trafficking with messages and issues most relevant to them, such as the rights and recourse available for male fishers in Thailand who experience some of the most severe forms of exploitation and how to identify legitimate labor recruiters before accepting domestic worker positions abroad. USAID/RDMA integrates gender equality and social inclusion approach in all aspects of the activities and prioritizes interventions to minimize disparities among women, girls and marginalized groups, thus reducing their vulnerability to trafficking in persons and victimization.

Human,None,,Impacts of Deforestation and Habitat Loss,"Deforestation means cutting or clearing trees and forests covering a large area, and not replanting them.
Forest degradation is a related term that indicates when a forest is no longer functioning as a healthy ecosystem: A degraded forest can no longer sustain populations the way it used to. For instance, it might not offer enough quality habitat or food to animals. In other words, when a forest is degraded it still exists, but it can no longer function well. It becomes a shell of its former self.

There are four different types of forests worldwide: tropical forests, temperate forests, and boreal forests and plantations. Deforestation is happening around the world with all forest types but occurs mostly in tropical areas. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) estimates that around 31% of the world’s land is covered by forests. But this forest coverage is under severe threat due to factors including agricultural expansion, infrastructure, and logging. “In 2019, the tropics lost close to 30 soccer fields’ worth of trees every single minute,” according to a WWF report.",Human,Human,Human,Human

Human,None,,Challenges and Opportunities in Space Tourism,"The Potential Benefits of Space Tourism to the Economy
Space tourism has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years as a potential way to boost the economy. Space tourism involves the commercialization of space, which could potentially provide a range of economic benefits.

Space tourism could create jobs, particularly in the area of space exploration and related services. With increased investment in space exploration, space tourism could create new opportunities for high-tech entrepreneurs and scientists who are interested in exploring space. In addition, space tourism could create more opportunities for research, development, and innovation in the space industry, which could lead to improvements in technology and new products and services.

Space tourism could also help to increase investment in space exploration and related activities. With increased investment, more funding could be available for research and development in space exploration and related fields. This could lead to greater opportunities for both private and public sector companies involved in space exploration.

Space tourism could also increase the demand for space-related products and services. As more people become interested in space exploration, they may purchase products related to space exploration or participate in space-related activities, such as space flight or space excursions. This could lead to increased revenue for companies involved in space-related activities, as well as increased employment opportunities.

Finally, space tourism could provide a number of other economic benefits. For example, it could help to increase public interest in space exploration, leading to more investments in space exploration activities. Space tourism could also create a platform for international collaboration and dialogue, as well as create new opportunities for economic growth and development.

Human,None,,Aging Population and Healthcare Challenges,"According to estimates, the proportion of older people (over 60 years) in Bangladesh will be 22 per cent in 2050 with about 36 million people compared to the current 8 per cent with about 13 million people. This suggests that for every five people, one will be an older person in Bangladesh. This fast aging of the country's population and the vast number of older people will greatly increase the demand for a number of social and healthcare services. Older people suffer from a diverse array of health conditions, need frequent healthcare access, have lower earnings, need special housing and transportation, as well as they, have more emotional needs. A great number of them will develop visual impairment, hearing loss will have difficulty in walking, continence of bowels and bladder. Osteoporosis, arthritis, high blood pressure, diabetes, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases are some prevalent health conditions in that age bracket. Is Bangladesh ready to take care of its older population?
FE

In Bangladesh, older peoples' livelihood difficulties will be further aggravated as only a third of them (33.4 per cent) older than pensionable age receive a pension and current social safety schemes in the country are still in infancy and trial stage and do not cover most of the people yet with or without economic insecurity. The trend shows that over time, there will be fewer and fewer working-age adults to support their old-age parents and dependents as the old-age dependency ratio is forecasted to triple in the next few decades. Population aging in Bangladesh will seriously impact individuals, families, society, government, NGOs, healthcare system, social service providers, and private-sector organizations as they all need to find solutions to issues on housing, social security, retirement, health care, caregiving, and the affliction of disease and disability.  The long term care (LTC) service delivery system is still in a nascent stage in Bangladesh with only sporadic and largely private individual-driven initiatives on developing small scale ""old homes"" here and there to serve only those older people who have no close family members alive, no one is willing or available to look after them or those who have no alternate means or support left for them.  LTC involves a variety of services designed to cater to the needs of a person- both healthcare and personal care- to help people live as independently and safely as possible when they become dependent on others to perform their everyday activities.

LTC is provided in different places by different caregivers, depending on needs. Most LTC is provided at home by volunteer family members and other relatives. It can also be arranged in a facility such as a nursing home or in the community as adult daycare centers. In Bangladesh, it is predicted that the current level of interest and availability of family members and relatives will decline over time to provide care for their dependents and this will create enormous challenges for these individuals to continue receiving care and large scale initiatives are to be in place to meet their uninterrupted and mounting care needs. While a few nursing homes -popularly called ""old homes"" have been built in Bangladesh but adult daycare centers remain to be a foreign concept and have not gotten any traction yet from any quarter.

The most common among LTC services is personal care-help with routine activities including bathing, dressing, grooming, eating, using the toilet, and moving around. LTC also includes delivering prepared meals and access to an adult daycare where older people can spend the day under supervision in company with peers, friends, and neighbors of similar age brackets (like daycare centers for children which are now popular in Bangladesh). Special transportation services will be needed as conventional vehicles in Bangladesh have no accommodation arrangements for people with special needs or for the aged population.

The LTC need usually grows progressively, as people get older and weaker and their illness or disability deteriorates over time. Several factors predict the type and amount of LTC need: the risk almost always increases as people get older; women are at higher risk than men as they have higher life expectancy; single, widows and widowers are more likely than married people to need care; poor nutrition habits and lack of physical activity can escalate a person's risk; poor health and family history also are associated with the care need. Research also suggests that low-income, very old people and people living without a spouse need more LTC.

Bangladesh needs to have plans, policies, and programmes in place, develop a legal framework, and start developing the structure and human resources (care providers) for its growing older population. Human resource policy is to be developed to create a large pool of trained and skilled formal, full-time to part-time, informal caregivers, and ensure an adequate supply of healthcare professionals such as Geriatricians, gerontologists, dieticians, nutritionists, nurses, nursing assistants, home health workers, social workers, care aides, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, and homemakers.",AI,Human,Human,Human

Blockchain chain has already started disrupting the financial services sector, and it is this technology which underpins the digital currency- bitcoin transaction.
With Blockchain technology in financial sector, the participants can interact directly and can make transactions across the internet without the interference of a third party. Such transactions through Blockchain will not share any personal information regarding the participants and it creates a transaction record by encrypting the identifying information. The most exciting feature of Blockchain is that it greatly reduces the possibilities of a data breach. In contrast with the traditional processes, in Blockchain there are multiple shared copies of the same data base which makes it challenging to wage a data breach attack or cyber-attack .

Human,None,,Evolution of Artificial Intelligence in Art and Creativity,"New technologies, and in particular artificial intelligence, are drastically changing the nature of creative processes. Computers are playing very significant roles in creative activities such as music, architecture, fine arts, and science. Indeed, the computer is already a canvas, a brush, a musical instrument, and so on. However, we believe that we must aim at more ambitious relations between computers and creativity. Rather than just seeing the computer as a tool to help human creators, we could see it as a creative entity in its own right. This view has triggered a new subfield of Artificial Intelligence called Computational Creativity. This article addresses the question of the possibility of achieving computational creativity through some examples of computer programs capable of replicating aspects of creative artistic behavior. We end with some reflections on the recent trend of democratization of creativity by means of assisting and augmenting human creativity.
Computational creativity is the study of building software that exhibits behavior that would be deemed creative in humans. Such creative software can be used for autonomous creative tasks, such as inventing mathematical theories, writing poems, painting pictures, and composing music. However, computational creativity studies also enable us to understand human creativity and to produce programs for creative people to use, where the software acts as a creative collaborator rather than a mere tool. Historically, it has been difficult for society to come to terms with machines that purport to be intelligent and even more difficult to admit that they might be creative. Even within Computer Science, people are still skeptical about the creative potential of software. A typical statement of detractors of computational creativity is that “simulating artistic techniques means also simulating human thinking and reasoning, especially creative thinking. This is impossible to do using algorithms or information processing systems.” We could not disagree more. As is hopefully evident from the examples in this paper, creativity is not some mystical gift that is beyond scientific study but rather something that can be investigated, simulated, and harnessed for the good of society. And while society might still be catching up, computational creativity as a discipline has come of age. This maturity is evident in the amount of activity related to computational creativity in recent years; in the sophistication of the creative software we are building; in the cultural value of the artifacts being produced by our software; and most importantly, in the consensus we are finding on general issues of computational creativity.",Human,Human,Human,Human
Human,None,,Ethical Considerations in Biotechnology,"Bioethics in biotechnology has historical and contemporary manifestations. Biotechnology is the field of biology that uses technology along with living organisms to create desired products. There are various fields of biotechnology, and the most used one is the field related to medicine and more. The field is also known as red biotechnology. Various testing and experiments are done in biotechnology to get adequate results, but these experiments are sometimes against ethics and more. 

Ethical Issues in Biotechnology
Ethical issues in biotechnology are specific issues that are morally wrong. Such issues can affect the fundamental moral principle that creates a massive conflict with the normal working of the society. We have divided the ethical issue related to biotechnology into specific subcategories. These groups are-

Socio-economic issues
Cultural issues
Legal issues
Environmental issues
Religious issues
There are several principles relating to ethics, medical ethics, scientific and technological ethics, justice and human dignity and its related ethics, and more of such ethical issues in biotechnology. 

Socio-economic issues
The scientific community and society promise significant advancement in biotechnology but never yours the harmlessness regarding socio-economic life. Such arguments and interactions are some of the most problematic ones to be considered out there. Social-economic issues interfere with the natural way or the initial god’s process of learning the environment. Search issues could be related to the cultural backgrounds, and also it could be on the level of different public awareness. The development of technology destroys the environment, which is a tricky thing. 

Cultural issues
Different cultures have different thoughts and values. These values are the reflection of their long-lasting concept. Sometimes biotechnology hinders these cultural concepts, which is not something to look out for. Biotechnology has given us everything to improve the quality of life. Still, if one interferes with the cultural aspect of the human, there can be ethical issues arising from such matters. 

Environmental issues
Environmental issues are also severe to look out for regarding ethical issues in biotechnology. Ecological issues might arise when one destroys the living flora or the fauna. Gene manipulation of different crops to produce hybrids is one of the most problematic issues. Even for most biotech experiments, other organisms are made to sacrifice. Due to such harsh sacrifices, numerous plant and animal species have been mutated regularly. Crops such as sugarcane have gone through genetic mutation and recombination, which has continuously destroyed the original constituent of the crop. Due to the prolonged mutation, these crops get mutated for a generation. The genes pass from one progeny to another, degrading the quality of the organism. 

Religious issues
One of the most faced issues with biotechnology is that it hurts people’s sentiments on a religious basis. The cow is considered to be very sacred by Hindus. People pray for the animals in countries such as India. Many plants are considered very sacred. Religious issues can be exceptionally sentimental and personal, and people get free attached to such matters. Some holy plants and animals are blessed and very sacred to lots of communities. These communities protect the organisms at any cause. Killing these organisms is a matter of deep concern. 

Other legal issues
Special laws protect many plants and animals. These laws protect these animals and plants from being disturbed to overcome. Many sacred plants and animals are manipulated for other experimental uses from their natural home. Sometimes due to the limitation of the organism reacting to biotechnology, the choice becomes very harsh. In such a case, these organisms are used, but this can create a severe law issue if the sacrifice for the mutation goes wrong. Different governments have different restrictions and rules regarding these species and their uses. Hence, a scientist must be aware that it must be legal to operate according to the country’s laws before using specific species for Biotechnology. 

Conclusion
Bioethics in biotechnology has always been problematic when we see it from the view of development. On the other hand, keeping moral integrity is also one of the essential jobs for a scientist or a developer. But sometimes, the thin boundary between ethics and experiments is violated.",Human,Human,Human,Human
Human,None,,Income Inequality and Economic Disparities,"income inequality, in economics, significant disparity in the distribution of income between individuals, groups, populations, social classes, or countries. Income inequality is a major dimension of social stratification and social class. It affects and is affected by many other forms of inequality, such as inequalities of wealth, political power, and social status. Income is a major determinant of quality of life, affecting the health and well-being of individuals and families, and varies by social factors such as sex, age, and race or ethnicity.

On a global level, income inequality is extreme by any measure, with the richest 1 percent of people in the world receiving as much as the bottom 56 percent in the early 21st century. Within the United States, income inequality is much greater than in most other developed countries. In 2014, the richest 1 percent received 22 percent of total income, and the top 10 percent of U.S. households received about 60 percent of total income.

Kinds of income inequality
One’s occupation is a central basis for differences in income for most people. In more-developed countries such as the United States, wages and salaries are the major source of income for most households, while property, including capital gains, is the major source for the most affluent. Income inequality can be studied within countries, between countries, or across the world’s population without regard to national boundaries.

Despite popular belief that income inequality largely reflects individual differences in talent and motivation, there are also significant structural and cultural causes, such as segmented labour markets, discrimination, institutionalized racism and sexism, gender roles, and family responsibilities. Other legal, political, and economic factors—such as corporate power, degree of private versus public (or common) ownership and control of resources, collective-bargaining frameworks, and minimum-wage laws—also affect income levels independently of individual traits. Income inequalities can have different implications for levels of well-being in different countries, depending on whether other basic needs such as housing, health care, and food are largely market-based and on whether people have access to productive resources such as land, water, and technology.

In 2010, the top 5 percent of U.S. households received more than 24 percent of total after-tax income, while the lowest 20 percent received slightly more than 6 percent. Income inequality in the United States has been rising since 1979. From 1979 to 2007, average after-tax income increased by 18 percent for the bottom fifth of the population and by 275 percent for the top 1 percent. During that period, the share of total after-tax income received by the top fifth of the population increased by 10 percent (most of that amount went to the top 1 percent), while the share received by the bottom four-fifths decreased by 2 to 3 percent. There are also sharp income disparities by race, age, and sex. While the male-female wage gap in the United States has been decreasing, in part because of declining wages for men, disparities still persist: black and Hispanic families and female-headed households are more likely to be poor or near-poor than other households.

A principal cause of rising income inequality in the United States has been the erosion of wages for less-educated workers, along with tax cuts disproportionately benefiting the richest households. This decline in real wages is linked to a number of factors, such as the loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States, the decline in the percentage of unionized jobs with benefits, the decline in the real value of the minimum wage, and the growth of service-sector jobs, many of which are low-paying.",Human,Human,Human,AI

However between the 1970s and the 1990s, plastic waste generation more than tripled, reflecting a similar rise in plastic production.
In the early 2000s, the amount of plastic waste we generated rose more in a single decade than it had in the previous 40 years.
Today, we produce about 400 million tonnes of plastic waste every year.
We are seeing other worrying trends. Since the 1970s, the rate of plastic production has grown faster than that of any other material. If historic growth trends continue, global production of primary plastic is forecasted to reach 1,100 million tonnes by 2050. We have also seen a worrying shift towards single-use plastic products, items that are meant to be thrown away after a single short use.
Approximately 36 per cent of all plastics produced are used in packaging, including single-use plastic products for food and beverage containers, approximately 85 per cent of which ends up in landfills or as unregulated waste.
Additionally, some 98 per cent of single-use plastic products are produced from fossil fuel, or ""virgin"" feedstock. The level of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production, use and disposal of conventional fossil fuel-based plastics is forecast to grow to 19 per cent of the global carbon budget by 2040.
These single-use plastic products are everywhere. For many of us, they have become an integral part of our daily lives.",Human,Human,Human,AI
Human,None,,Mental Health Effects of Climate Anxiety,"Whether you work for a fossil-fuel loving bank or energy firm, a car manufacturer or a telco company – aligning your career to your climate ethics could have huge mental health benefits, says University of Melbourne Associate Professor Dr. Grant Blashki.

Does where we work affect how we feel? What happens when our ethics conflict with our job description? According to climate anxiety specialist Dr. Grant Blashki, author of Climate, Health and Courage, when our values and our work are out of sync, something has to give, and that something is often our mental health.

""People who work in a place that aligns with their values, that they feel good about, and that’s contributing in a positive way to the future, they will feel better about their mental health,"" says Dr. Blashki. ""They’ll feel less conflicted.""

This conflict – the battle between how we feel and how we act – is known to psychologists as 'cognitive dissonance'. It’s what happens when your external actions contradict your internal values.

This clash is usually uncomfortable. It tends to manifest as a low-grade existential background pain, an uneasiness, which can feel more acute at certain times (e.g. watching catastrophic, real-world climate impacts on TV and feeling helpless in the face of them).

""Not every job is going to be exactly in alignment with your values, there’s no perfect job,"" says Dr. Blashki. “But if we can get to where our daily behaviours are aligning with our beliefs, it’s a much less stressful way to live.""

How to harness your climate anxiety for good
Most people get around cognitive dissonance by changing one of the variables: either how they feel, or how they act. And we’re already seeing this with employees. According to recent surveys, 71 per cent of Gen Z workers and 52 per cent of Millennials said they wouldn’t work for a business that didn’t take action on climate change. Almost half of Australians (48 per cent) felt the same way. Studies show that we’re three times more worried about climate change than COVID, and all that worry takes a mental toll.

""Most people, especially young people, want a strong sense of alignment with their values and their work,"" Dr. Blashki says. ""COVID has amplified that, too. Even the fact that we’re physically working from home now, there’s less sense of a split identity. Before, you could go to work, make money, and then live your life according to your values. Now people feel like their worlds have merged.""

""Every year when I teach my climate change course, I look at the graphs and think, bloody hell, are those things real? It’s an incredibly stressful problem. And logically, if you’ve got that tension between your values and your work, that will increase your level of stress.""
So what can we do about climate anxiety and cognitive dissonance? Is there a way to reconcile where you work with how you feel? To switch off the background pain? The good news is that there’s plenty that employees can do to feel less anxious, and less conflicted. The first step is simply taking action. If you can’t change companies, you can at least change your company.

""First of all, find a little piece of the puzzle that you can contribute to, because otherwise people tend to feel overwhelmed and powerless,"" Dr. Blashki says. ""Find an area that fits your skills, your experience, share you concerns with like-minded people, and never feel like it’s all on you.""",Human,Human,Human,Human
Human,None,,Impacts of Remote Work on Lifestyle and Society,"A recent IGEES evaluation of the impacts of remote working contains some very interesting findings.  The report evaluates the impacts of remote working to the Irish economy and society, building on the goals set out in the National Remote Work Strategy.  Overall, the evaluation finds that remote working is likely to have a positive impact on the Irish economy and society.

Main findings

Recent data indicates that, on average, management and employees alike expect remote working to improve productivity. It is likely to be the case that remote working boosts productivity in many occupations but reduces it in others.
Evidence suggests that remote working should improve labour market outcomes for both people with disabilities and caring responsibilities. Remote work enables improved access to the workplace through greater flexibility in terms of time management, childcare and commuting options. It is important however that firms do not use remote working to avoid providing required workplace provisions for people with disabilities.
Housing demand in more rural regions outstripped that of cities, at least in 2021. The evaluation found there to be an inverse relationship between recent house price and rent growth, and population density.
Emissions savings made from reduced transport usage are likely to exceed any extra household emissions, leading to net environmental gains from remote working. This paper estimates that remote working has the potential to save 164,407 tonnes of CO2 a year, with an equivalent monetary saving of €7.6m.
The evaluation finds that potential cost savings for employees could be large, with any increases in heating and electricity costs likely to be outweighed by a reduction in commuting costs. Estimated annual increases in heating and electricity costs for households are €79 and €30 respectively. Potential savings from reduced commuting are estimated to be €413 per remote worker. Remote workers can save an average of 93 hours per year through reduced commuting – with an equivalent monetary benefit of €1,103.
Firms too can make significant cost savings if they downscale expensive city centre offices.  Past IGEES studies indicate potential benefits for firms to be approximately €1,492 per employee per year. This is on top of benefits accrued through improved employee productivity.
It is still unknown at this time what the impact of remote working will be on the Exchequer. There are potential costs of €200m per year, although the majority of this is likely to come through a reduction in ‘corrective’ tax receipts, such as excise duties.
As for most remote workers and firms, benefits of remote working are likely to outweigh the costs; there is likely to be little market failure for the government to correct. While blanket spend to encourage remote working could lead to deadweight loss, targeted spending measures could improve remote working outcomes for specific cohorts (e.g., people with disabilities).",Human,Human,Human,Human
Human,None,,Refugee Crisis and Global Migration Patterns,"On March 14, 2019, Tropical Cyclone Idai struck the southeast coast of Mozambique. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reported that 1.85 million people needed assistance. 146,000 people were internally displaced, and Mozambique scrambled to house them in 155 temporary sites.1 The cyclone and subsequent flooding damaged 100,000 homes, destroyed 1 million acres of crops, and demolished $1 billion worth of infrastructure.2

One historic storm in one place over the course of one day. While Cyclone Idai was the worst storm in Mozambique’s history, the world is looking towards a future where these “unprecedented” storms are commonplace. This global challenge has and will continue to create a multitude of critical issues that the international community must confront, including:

Large-scale human migration due to resource scarcity, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and other factors, particularly in the developing countries in the earth’s low latitudinal band
Intensifying intra- and inter-state competition for food, water, and other resources, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa
Increased frequency and severity of disease outbreaks
Increased U.S. border stress due to the severe effects of climate change in parts of Central America
All of these challenges are serious, but the scope and scale of human migration due to climate change will test the limits of national and global governance as well as international cooperation.

The migration-climate nexus is real, but more scrutiny and action are required
In 2018, the World Bank estimated that three regions (Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia) will generate 143 million more climate migrants by 2050.3 In 2017, 68.5 million people were forcibly displaced, more than at any point in human history. While it is difficult to estimate, approximately one-third of these (22.5 million4 to 24 million5 people) were forced to move by “sudden onset” weather events—flooding, forest fires after droughts, and intensified storms. While the remaining two-thirds of displacements are the results of other humanitarian crises, it is becoming obvious that climate change is contributing to so-called slow onset events such as desertification, sea-level rise, ocean acidification, air pollution, rain pattern shifts and loss of biodiversity.6 This deterioration will exacerbate many humanitarian crises and may lead to more people being on the move.

Multilateral institutions, development agencies, and international law must do far more to thoroughly examine the challenges of climate change (early efforts, like the World Bank’s 2010 World Development Report on climate change,7 had little uptake at a time when few thought a climate crisis was around the corner). Moreover, neither a multilateral strategy nor a legal framework exist to account for climate change as a driver of migration. Whether in terms of limited access to clean water, food scarcity, agricultural degradation, or violent conflict,8 climate change will intensify these challenges and be a significant push factor in human migration patterns.

To date, there are only a few cases where climate change is the sole factor prompting migration. The clearest examples are in the Pacific Islands. The sea level is rising at a rate of 12 millimeters per year in the western Pacific and has already submerged eight islands. Two more are on the brink of disappearing, prompting a wave of migration to larger countries.910 By 2100, it is estimated that 48 islands overall will be lost to the rising ocean.11 In 2015, the Teitota family applied for refugee status in New Zealand, fleeing the disappearing island nation of Kiribati.12 Their case, the first request for refuge explicitly attributed climate change, made it to the High Court of New Zealand but was ultimately dismissed. Islands in the Federated States of Micronesia have drastically reduced in size, washed down to an uninhabitable state, had their fresh water contaminated by the inflow of seawater, and disappeared in the past decade.13 Despite their extreme vulnerability, the relatively small population (2.3 million people spread across 11 countries14) and remote location of the Pacific Islands means that they garner little international action, for all the attention they receive in the media.",Human,Human,Human,Human
Human,None,,Impact of Social Media on Political Discourse,"Politics and society are being impacted by social media more and more. Social media has been essential in organizing social movements, amplifying voices, and influencing political discourse, from the Arab Spring revolutions to the Black Lives Matter movement.

Social media, at its heart, signifies a profound change in how we communicate and consume information. Unlike traditional media, social media enables real-time involvement and interaction, creating a platform for various voices and viewpoints to be heard.

However, the growth of social media has also introduced new hazards and concerns. While algorithms and echo chambers have reinforced preexisting biases and impeded access to different points of view, political actors have utilized social media to propagate propaganda, disinformation, and hate speech.

In order to comprehend how social media affects political discourse, we must look at how it has affected the way we receive and disseminate information, how it influences public opinion and political ideologies, and the potential and difficulties it poses for the future of democracy.

This article examines the role of social media in influencing political discourse in the digital era, drawing on concepts from global views, communication, and mass media theory. We examine the influence of social media on political ideas, how political actors utilize social media to shape the public agenda, and the problems and opportunities posed by social media for the future of democracy through a survey of pertinent scholarly articles, news media, and other sources.

The Influence of Social Media on Political Perspectives

Social media’s emergence has altered how individuals consume political news and information, with far-reaching ramifications for political participation and engagement. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have become important sources of information and news for many individuals, impacting their political opinions and beliefs.

One way social media has altered political ideas is by allowing for real-time discussion and involvement. Users can instantly share and consume political content on social media, breaking down conventional barriers to political debate and creating a more participatory environment. Individuals and groups who were previously marginalized in traditional political arenas have been empowered, allowing them to speak their opinions and interact with others who share their perspectives.

However, social media has also aided in disseminating misinformation and propaganda, which can harm democracy. Algorithms that promote interaction and virality can reinforce existing prejudices while limiting exposure to various points of view, resulting in echo chambers that reinforce existing ideas while limiting exposure to other perspectives. This can polarize political discourse even further and contribute to the disintegration of democratic norms and institutions.

Despite these obstacles, social media offers new political engagement and participation avenues. Social media, for example, has been used to mobilize social movements and draw attention to critical social and political concerns. It has also provided new places for civic participation and citizen journalism, allowing people to engage in politics in new and important ways.

Theoretical approaches like the networked public sphere and digital citizenship can help us understand how social media affects political ideas and involvement. The networked public sphere refers to the digital spaces where people engage in political debate and share information. Digital citizenship, on the other hand, emphasizes the role of individuals in changing the online environment through their participation and interaction. We can better comprehend the intricate interplay between social media and political ideas in the digital age if we consider these theoretical approaches with empirical studies.",Human,Human,Human,AI
Human,None,,Advancements in Quantum Computing,"Quantum computers today are small in computational scope — the chip inside your smartphone contains billions of transistors while the most powerful quantum computer contains a few hundred of the quantum equivalent of a transistor. They are also unreliable. If you run the same calculation over and over, they will most likely churn out different answers each time.

But with their intrinsic ability to consider many possibilities at once, quantum computers do not have to be very large to tackle certain prickly problems of computation, and on Wednesday, IBM researchers announced that they had devised a method to manage the unreliability in a way that would lead to reliable, useful answers.

“What IBM showed here is really an amazingly important step in that direction of making progress towards serious quantum algorithmic design,” said Dorit Aharonov, a professor of computer science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem who was not involved with the research.

While researchers at Google in 2019 claimed that they had achieved “quantum supremacy” — a task performed much more quickly on a quantum computer than a conventional one — IBM’s researchers say they have achieved something new and more useful, albeit more modestly named.

“We’re entering this phase of quantum computing that I call utility,” said Jay Gambetta, a vice president of IBM Quantum. “The era of utility.”

A team of IBM scientists who work for Dr. Gambetta described their results in a paper published on Wednesday in the journal Nature.

Present-day computers are called digital, or classical, because they deal with bits of information that are either 1 or 0, on or off. A quantum computer performs calculations on quantum bits, or qubits, that capture a more complex state of information. Just as a thought experiment by the physicist Erwin Schrödinger postulated that a cat could be in a quantum state that is both dead and alive, a qubit can be both 1 and 0 simultaneously.",Human,Human,Human,Human
Human,None,,The Role of Media in Shaping Public Opinion,"The media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and influencing political outcomes. In modern democracies, the media serves as a bridge between the government and the citizens, providing them with information, analysis, and perspectives on political issues.

This article explores the significant role of media in shaping public opinion and its impact on political outcomes.

One of the primary functions of the media is to inform the public about current events, political developments, and government policies. Through newspapers, television, radio, and digital platforms, the media disseminates news, providing citizens with vital information to make informed decisions.

By reporting on political campaigns, policy debates, and legislative activities, the media keeps the public aware of the issues that affect their lives and the choices they have in shaping political outcomes.

Media also plays a crucial role in agenda setting, determining which issues receive attention and coverage.

Through the selection and framing of news stories, media organizations can shape public perception and prioritize specific topics or narratives.

By highlighting certain issues and downplaying others, the media has the power to influence public opinion and direct attention toward specific political matters. This agenda-setting function can significantly impact political outcomes by influencing the public’s priorities and the issues they consider important.

Media outlets have the ability to frame news stories in a particular way that can influence public opinion. The choice of words, images, and the overall presentation can shape the narrative and interpretation of events.

Media framing can influence how the public perceives politicians, policies, and political parties. Biases in reporting, whether intentional or unintentional, can also shape public opinion by emphasizing certain perspectives and downplaying others. The media’s framing and bias can sway public sentiment and subsequently impact political outcomes such as election results or policy decisions.

The media serves as a platform for public discourse and political debate. Through opinion articles, talk shows, and social media platforms, citizens can express their views and engage in discussions on political matters.

Media outlets provide a forum for diverse perspectives, allowing the public to engage in dialogue and exchange ideas. This exchange of ideas can shape public opinion by exposing individuals to different viewpoints, challenging their beliefs, and fostering a more informed and nuanced understanding of political issues.

In turn, public opinion influences political outcomes through voting behavior, participation in political movements, and advocacy for specific policies. An important role of the media is to act as a watchdog, holding politicians and government institutions accountable. Through investigative journalism and reporting on government actions, the media exposes corruption, abuse of power, and unethical behavior.

By shedding light on such issues, the media can influence public opinion and shape political outcomes by mobilizing public support for reforms, encouraging citizen activism, and putting pressure on politicians to address the concerns raised by the media.

The media’s role in shaping public opinion and its impact on political outcomes cannot be underestimated. As a vital source of information and a platform for public discourse, the media influences how citizens perceive political events, policies, and actors.

By setting the agenda, framing news stories, and providing a platform for diverse viewpoints, the media can shape public opinion and subsequently impact political outcomes.

However, it is crucial for media organizations to adhere to ethical standards and maintain a commitment to impartiality, accuracy, and fairness to ensure the integrity of their role in a democratic society.",Human,Human,Human,AI
Human,None,,Biodiversity Conservation and Ecosystem Restoration,"Nature, in its untamed state, possesses incredible capabilities to shape landscapes and ecosystems through natural processes. These processes include flooding, weather conditions, natural calamities, natural grazing, predation, and scavenging. The revival of natural processes lies at the heart of nature recovery and more naturally functioning ecosystems.

Rewilding Europe is creating enabling conditions for nature to thrive within now ten rewilding landscapes.

Human,None,,Challenges and Benefits of 3D Printing Technology,"3D printing, also called “additive manufacturing (AM)” or “rapid prototyping (RP)”, is a process of using computer-aided designs or manufacturing technology to make three-dimensional products from digital models. 3D printing technology has been applied to various industries, such as tooling, automotive, aerospace consumer products and others. But it’s still relatively new to dentistry. Today we will present you the major advantages and challenges of 3D printing in dentistry compared to traditional technology to help you better understand their differences.
Advantages:

1. Allowing for Customization

Customization means to change or revise an existing product to meet customers’ special needs. When applying traditional technology in dentistry, it is hard to create customized products as the products are created with a mold and it’s unrealistic for manufacturers to create a new mold for each product. This usually comes with batch production, while with 3D printing, it’s achieved by first scanning the products into a 3D computer model, then by being 3D-printed to match the product exactly. It’s a digital work. That means for any changes on products, we only need to change the digital work. It’s much easier without any additional cost and this customization can help patients speed up their recoveries and reduce their pains.
2. More Precise and Accurate
As mentioned above, 3D printing is a digital work, which means it’s computer-controlled and can be customized even with complex structures while in traditional technology, it’s totally relying on mold, so 3D printing can provide a more precise and accurate solution for dentistry application.
3. Cost-effective



3D printing doesn’t rely on any mold and it can be adapted to any product directly only by revising the digital work, while with traditional technology, we need to change the mold to meet customer’s unique needs which may cause unnecessary waste.



4. High-efficiency



3D printing is fast and relatively cheap. You just need to create the computer model by scanning it, then being printed directly. It may only take several days instead of weeks, while with traditional technology, it usually takes a longer time as you need to create additional mold or tools.



5. Labor-saving



With 3D printing, most of the manufacturing processes can be conducted by automation with high efficiency and precision, which, in other words, means less manpower will be needed compared to traditional technology which rely on lots of low-skill jobs to keep their manufacturing operating. As a result, labor costs will be reduced dramatically with 3D printing in dentistry.



Challenges:



1. Job Losses



As the application of 3D printing technology can make manufacturing faster and cheaper and most of the steps can be automated which will save the labor cost dramatically, this will result in job losses as fewer people will be hired in the manufacturing industry.



2. Restricted Size



The size of printed products in dentistry should be restricted to the chamber sizes of the 3D printers. But this challenge will not be an issue anymore as we have developed larger and larger 3D printers to meet various kinds of requirements.



In a word, there will be more advantages after adopting 3D printing in dentistry. For the challenges, the companies are striving hard to overcome them, so as to continue providing perfect solutions for customers. We are sure 3D printing will be widely applied in dentistry soon!",Human,Human,Human,Human
Human,None,,Privacy Concerns with Emerging Technologies,"Technology development is moving more quickly than ever. Each new breakthrough makes the next one easier. Just as cloud computing and GPUs opened up a new era of AI, more ubiquitous wireless communications made connected devices possible. But these emerging technologies deliver privacy implications along with social benefits.

AI Privacy
Most AI algorithms wouldn’t work without large amounts of data. Data scientists train them using extensive collections of whatever they’re trying to process, such as images, audio snippets, or text. The use and handling of this data raise privacy questions. Where did the data come from? Does it contain any personal information? Who gave consent for its use, and what kinds of processing did they consent to?

AI users often act first and ask forgiveness later, either intentionally or through ignorance. One such company was Clearview AI, an American company that harvested billions of images without permission from popular sites, including Twitter and Facebook. It used scraping software to harvest the images without the companies’ or the subjects’ consent. Then it used them to build a facial recognition database which it made available to law enforcement organisations for a fee. Until the American Civil Liberties Union sued, it also sold access to private businesses and individuals.

Clearview AI’s scraping infringed upon the companies’ access policies, prompting several cease and desist letters. It also violated regional privacy laws according to three European countries and the UK. They all ordered it to remove their citizens’ images from its database, but the company stores this data elsewhere and has dismissed the ICO’s penalties.

Privacy issues also arise in how and where the algorithms are used. UK law enforcement has used live facial recognition to identify individuals in public places. Cambridge University condemned this as an infringement of human rights. In some cases, private companies such as retail outlets have used facial recognition systems to recognise visitors without their consent.

AI’s ability to process large amounts of information and spit out an easily digestible result (say, a decision on a loan application) also throws data privacy into the spotlight. Reports of algorithmic bias are rife. This happens when some demographic groups are under-represented in source data or where data points are given inappropriate importance in the data model. If individuals don’t get the chance to consent to their data’s use in these models – or if they do not understand the implications – their human rights and those of others in their communities could suffer.

Privacy in IoT
Another nascent technology, the Internet of Things (IoT), has also sparked privacy concerns. Everything from cars to children’s watches now gather and relay user data. Cars collect information about users, including their location and their driving behaviour. In California, from the beginning of this year, the Consumer Privacy Rights Act amends the existing Consumer Privacy Protection Act, which would, among other things, enable drivers to opt out of car vendors sending this kind of information to insurance companies. Manufacturers must tiptoe around the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

IoT companies often also mishandle this data. Researchers have found servers hosting geolocation data from cheap children’s watches vulnerable to data breaches, putting minors at risk.

Lawmakers have imposed baseline security measures for IoT manufacturers. California was among the first. The UK has enacted its Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure (PSTI) Bill, while the EU has proposed its own Cyber Resilience Act. However, with much of the vulnerable data stored outside the EU, it remains to be seen how useful these will be.

Blockchain Privacy
Our third nascent technology, blockchains, ostensibly protect privacy through disintermediation. They remove a central party that traditionally facilitates and documents transactions, like a bank. Instead, the blockchain serves as a distributed ledger that allows everyone to transact directly while retaining their own cryptographically proven copies of the ledger. That stops a central party from misusing or losing the data.

However, the threat to privacy comes in how blockchains store information. For example, the public Ethereum blockchain stores everything in plain view, including the addresses people use to make transactions. Ethereum’s creator Vitalik Buterin has described privacy as “one of the largest remaining challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem”. He proposed using stealth addresses – one-time disposable addresses that disguise a transaction’s author – as a possible solution.

Other forms of blockchain are less susceptible to these privacy issues. For example, private blockchains only grant access to members of a specific community. The information on these blockchains is not publicly visible, meaning only members can see what’s happening. However, these blockchains are used in a subset of use cases, commonly in industry verticals such as supply chain management and finance.

New technologies often enable us to do things that were impossible before, but they also introduce new dangers. That calls for a reconsideration of user rights and how to protect them. Facebook’s old mantra, “Move fast and break things,” was an ode to disruption. However, when the things you’re breaking include social constructs such as trust and fairness, the onus is on legal and regulatory experts to move just as quickly.",Human,Human,Human,Human
Human,None,,Semiconductor Industry In Future,"Is it possible to predict the future? Of course not. We all make projections of what happened in the past, where they are now, and the implications for the future. We bias that in various ways and think we are making some astounding revelation, which is highly unlikely to become true. Of course, by luck, some people get it right and they are bestowed with grand accolades and awards. The likelihood of them ever getting anything else right is highly unlikely.

Or is it? How much of a role does luck play in this? It’s easier to assess if we turn it around. There are some people who seem to be very unlucky. I believe this is partly because they make bad decisions that increase the likelihood of bad things happening to them. I choose not to be impacted by hurricanes, which happen very frequently and somewhat predictably, and getting worse because of global warming, so I do not live in the Gulf states. I do accept the risk that a Cascadia subduction plate slippage could destroy the infrastructure where I live and cause untold damage and possibly loss of life. This happens once every 500 years or so, and I have taken reasonable steps to prepare for this event.

But what about semiconductors? In the past, many have talked about the end of Moore’s Law and been wrong. While it is more likely to be true this time around, it is not really relevant. What’s more important is a discussion about how a system is going to be better today than it was yesterday, because the industry is certainly facing a big storm. The lucky ones will be those who can navigate it, survive, and reap the benefits.

That requires companies to be nimble and adaptable to change. Will they continue to pack more transistors onto a single die, or will they deploy multiple dies connected together in a package? Will they explore new architectures or question decisions that were made decades ago? Will they explore new models of computation to deal with the evolving problem types that are transforming from being control-dominated to ones that are dataflow-oriented? Every one of these changes involves risk, but the one thing they all have in common is that they require an open mind and innovation.

In the past, change often has been driven by a fresh set of innovators, and they often attempt things that industry veterans will retort, ‘Tried that, didn’t work.’ But things have changed, and things that did not work in the past may be the new way forward. Many innovations were ahead of their time, and that often means the need was not large enough in the past and perhaps it is now.

I once claimed we could learn nothing of importance by looking at the past where semiconductors were concerned. I was wrong. Many things that were once abandoned are being revitalized. Many ideas that were too expensive at the time are now showing a lot more promise. A good example is memory. Alternative memory technologies have existed for decades, and they always were inferior in one manner or another. In many cases, the disadvantages were created because of other decisions that were made. For example, optimizing process technology for logic means it is not ideal for memory or analog or a number of other functions. But pressures are building. Flash and DRAM are having increasing problems scaling. A small change could make alternative memories a lot more attractive, if only we would give them a chance. Then, when they see an equal amount of investment compared to the incumbents, they may provide the breakthrough necessary for all manner of other innovations.

The impact of one decision can influence others. What if we gave up having notions of a single contiguous memory space as required by a von Neumann architecture? Sure, software would take a huge hit, but it could lead to much better, more efficient software that is amenable to a lot more automation than it is today. With a more analyzable software base, it would become easier for software engineers to create hardware, and that would open a whole new world of creativity. Most people are naysayers when it comes to software-driven high-level synthesis, because it is unlikely to create hardware as good as, or better than hand crafted. But what if there were 10X as many hardware designers, each with 10X more productivity?

The semiconductor industry has been chugging along without any fundamental innovation for a long time. There has been incremental innovation everywhere and that is what has driven most of the progress. In AI, it took a change from rule-based systems to statistical algorithms to enable the dramatic growth that we see today. Today, whole ecosystems have been created around that one innovation, and it has turned into a multi-trillion-dollar change.

I predict that companies will fail if they assume the future will look similar to the past four decades. What they need to do is innovate, and there are many ways to do that. Perhaps the best way is through the university system. It is too expensive for most companies to innovate because their expectation for results forces them into corners. Instead, companies should increase funding to universities, where many ideas can be explored quickly and cheaply. Maybe only 1 in 10 will be interesting, and 1 in 100 adoptable. Only 1 in 1 million will be transformational. Don’t expect them to create answers. Expect them to create the germs of innovation that can be incorporated into your future.

Luck happens when we create opportunities for success and when we nurture ideas, and those ideas shape the future.",Human,Human,Human,Human
